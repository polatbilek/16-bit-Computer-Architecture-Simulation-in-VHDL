# 16bit Computer Architecture Simulation in VHDL
This work is a simultion of a 16-bit computer architecture where ROM and RAM and all other stuff is available

Some tips:


1) There is a file uPabs3.pdf in source which includes specs of the architecture
2) This work is done on the course of CENG311 at IZTECH in 2016
3) testbench.vhd is like the main file where all operations are collected in
4) I am sorry for lack of comments, if you need any clarification please contact me
5) The OP codes are defined in uPabs3.pdf, already small code example is written in ROM
